        emotion believing life is meaningless? This is a common misconception and could not be
        further from the truth. Stoicism in summary is the practice of living a virtuous life,
        being courageous, self-disciplined, and realizing the things within our control and not
        within our control. Stoicism originated in Athens, Greece in the 3 rd century BC and has
        been made famous by the three main stoic philosophers, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius,
        and Seneca. Epictetus was a former slave and teacher. Marcus Aurelius was one of the
        great Roman emperors and Seneca was the powerful and wealthy advisor to Nero.
        Unlike some of the other schools of thought, Stoicism has practical application and
        possess the potential to change your life. We invite you to learn the some of the
        teachings of the stoic philosophers that remain relevant today. As you begin this

          <h3>Marcus Aurelius</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/marcus-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Marcus" class="img-thumbnail rounded-circle thumbnail">
          <p>Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, commonly known as the Roman Emperor
            Marcus Aurelius (161–180 CE). is known as one of the last “five good emperors” and for his
            book Meditations, the widely popular book that details Marcus’s daily challenges and
            Stoic philosophy, which he wrote as personal diary.
          </p>
          <h4>Stoicism</h4>
          <p>Many find Marcus the most interesting of the Stoic philosophers. As ruler of the
            Roman empire he could possess anything he ever wanted possible. Marcus still took to
            Stoic philosophy and practiced living the virtuous life. He, of course, still faced
            adversity every day and used Stoicism as a tool to deal with the day to day stresses of
            running an empire. This led to his writings ‘Meditations’, a journal for Marcus to
            express his thoughts. Upon his death bed, Marcus ordered this journal to be
            destroyed, but fortunately for us it remains, and is now one of the most prolific stoic
            books today. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a> can be purchased in our <a href="store.html">store</a></p>

          <h3>Seneca</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/seneca-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Seneca" class="img-thumbnail rounded-circle thumbnail">
          <p>Seneca, in full Lucius Annaeus Seneca, byname Seneca the Younger, was a Roman
            philosopher, statesman, orator, and tragedian. He was one of Rome’s leading intellectual
            figure in the mid-1st century CE and became advisor to Nero during the first phase of
            the emperor’s reign. This ultimately led to his death in 65 CE Rome.
          </p>
          <h4>Stoicism</h4>
          <p>Seneca was a wealthy and powerful man in Roman society however his life was not
            without turbulence. Seneca was an admirer of the stoic philosopher Cato and he
            commonly quoted passages from other schools of thought. He commonly quoted
            Epicurus. He is most famous for his collection of letters ‘On the shortness of Life’ and
            ‘Letters from a Stoic’. Seneca life is interesting as he faced periods of adversity and
            prosperity, the prosperity of which came from being the advisor to the emperor Nero.
            Senecas ultimate end came at the hands of the emperor Nero. Senecas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistulae_Morales_ad_Lucilium">Letters from a

          <h3>Epictetus</h3>
          <img src="assets/images/epictetus-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Epictetus" class="img-thumbnail rounded-circle thumbnail">
          <p>Epictetus, his original name is not known; epiktētos is the Greek word meaning
            “acquired.” As a boy he was a slave but managed to attend lectures by the Stoic
            Musonius Rufus. He later became a freedman soon after emperor Nero's death. He opened a school Stoicism in Greece and
            taught there for the remainder of his life. until he died CE 135.</p>
          <h4>Stoicism</h4>
          <p>The life of Epictetus is fascinating as he was able to
            practice the philosophy of Stoicism whilst being a slave. This is in contrast with how
            Seneca and Marcus Aurelius spent their lives. Epictetus obtained his freedom after the
            death of Nero and taught philosophy in Rome for several years until the Emperor
            Domitian banished all philosophers from Rome. Epictetus is famous for being a teacher and
            his teachings are available in the book “Discourses”. This book contains his teachings that were
            logged from one of his students. The teaching of
            Epictetus through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_of_Epictetus">Discourses</a> can purchased in our <a href="store.html">store.</a></p>
