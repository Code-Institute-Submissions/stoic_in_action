          <h3>Marcus Aurelius</h3>
          <img src="/assets/images/marcus-thumbnail.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail thumbnail">
          <p>Marcus Aurelius, in full Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, original name (until 161 CE) Marcus Annius Verus, (born April 26, 121 CE, Rome [Italy]—died March 17, 180, Vindobona [Vienna, Austria] or Sirmium, Pannonia), Roman emperor (161–180 CE), best known for his Meditations on Stoic philosophy. Marcus Aurelius has symbolized for many generations in the West the Golden Age of the Roman Empire.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5>Stoicism</h5>
          <p>As the ruler of the Roman Empire, many find Marcus as the most interesting of the Stoic philosophers. With his status and pretty much anything he wanted, Marcus still took to the philosophy and practiced living the virtous life. He, of course, still faced with advsersity every day used Stoicism as a tool to deal with lifes problems, which led to his writings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a> a sort of journal he wrote for his eyes only. Upon his death bed, Marcus had ordered for this journal to be destroyed but fortunately for us, it was not and is now, one of the most prolific stoic books today.

          <h3>Seneca</h3>
          <img src="/assets/images/seneca-thumbnail.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail thumbnail">
          <p>Seneca, in full Lucius Annaeus Seneca, byname Seneca the Younger, (born c. 4 BCE, Corduba (now Córdoba), Spain—died 65 CE, Rome [Italy]), Roman philosopher, statesman, orator, and tragedian. He was Rome’s leading intellectual figure in the mid-1st century CE and was virtual ruler with his friends of the Roman world between 54 and 62, during the first phase of the emperor Nero’s reign.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5>Stoicism</h5>
          <p>In Seneca's life he encountered alot adversity, so the need for Stoicism was apparent. He was met with jealousy during his early success in his career as a senator during Roman Emperor Caligula's reign, who ordered Seneca to kill himself but was advised otherwise beacause Seneca's health was so bad, Caligula was told he would die soon anyway. In 41 AD, he was exiled to Corsica for 8 years for charges of adultery, he was later recalled to Rome where he later served as praetor and tutor for future Emperor Nero. In AD 65, Seneca was caught up in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy, a plot to kill Nero. Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself. Seneca followed tradition by severing several veins in order to bleed to death, and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to share his fate. During his life Seneca wrote many letters (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistulae_Morales_ad_Lucilium">Letters from a Stoic</a>) to his friend Lucilius Junior- who was procurator of Sicily during Nero's reign - where he advised him on how to live the life of a Stoic.

          <h3>Epictetus</h3>
          <img src="/assets/images/epictetus-thumbnail.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail thumbnail">
          <p>Epictetus, (born AD 55, probably at Hierapolis, Phrygia [now Pamukkale, Turkey]—died c. 135, Nicopolis, Epirus [Greece]). His original name is not known; epiktētos is the Greek word meaning “acquired.” As a boy he was a slave but managed to attend lectures by the Stoic Musonius Rufus. He later became a freedman and lived his life lame and in ill health.</p>
          <h5>Stoicism</h5>
          <p>Epictetus spent his youth as a slave in Rome to Epaphroditos, a wealthy freedman and secretary to Nero. He obtained his freedom sometime after the death of Nero in 68 AD and he began to teach philosophy in Rome. His most famous pupil, Arrian, studied under him when a young man (ca. AD 108) and claimed to have written the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_of_Epictetus">Discourses</a> from his lecture notes, which he argued should be considered comparable to the Socratic literature. He lived a life of great simplicity, with few possessions. He lived alone for a long time, but in his old age he adopted a friend's child who otherwise would have been left to die, and raised him with the aid of a woman.
